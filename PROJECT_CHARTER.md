# Goal Bingo - Project Charter

## 1. Project Overview

### Project Name
**Goal Bingo**

### Project Vision
Create a dynamic, reward-driven goal achievement system that combines the excitement of bingo with personalized goal tracking, where users build a library of goals, play them in randomized bingo grids, and earn meaningful rewards for completing rows and columns.

### Project Mission
Develop an engaging web application that transforms goal achievement into an interactive game where users maintain a goal library, play with randomly selected goals in bingo grids, and celebrate achievements with self-defined rewards.

## 2. Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points
- Traditional goal tracking apps are static and lack dynamic engagement
- Users struggle with motivation to complete daily/weekly goals
- Goal tracking feels like a chore rather than an achievement
- No variety in goal presentation leads to monotony
- Lack of meaningful rewards for goal completion
- Goals become stale when presented in the same way repeatedly
- No sense of "winning" or progression when goals are achieved
- Difficulty maintaining long-term engagement with goal tracking

### Target Audience
- **Primary**: Individuals seeking to build better habits and achieve personal goals
- **Secondary**: Teams or groups wanting to gamify shared objectives
- **Tertiary**: Productivity enthusiasts and goal-setting practitioners

## 3. Project Objectives

### Primary Objectives
1. **Dynamic Goal Library**: Enable users to build and manage a comprehensive library of personal goals
2. **Randomized Bingo Grids**: Create engaging, ever-changing bingo grids populated from the goal library
3. **Reward System**: Implement a meaningful reward system where users earn self-defined rewards for completing rows/columns
4. **Goal State Management**: Track goals through multiple states (to-do, in-play, completed) with timestamps
5. **Progressive Engagement**: Maintain long-term engagement through variety and reward mechanics
6. **Flexible Input**: Support both free-text goal entry and guided/AI-assisted goal creation

### Success Metrics
- User retention rate > 70% after first week
- Average session duration > 5 minutes
- Goal completion rate improvement > 40% compared to traditional tracking
- User satisfaction score > 4.5/5

## 4. Project Scope

### In Scope (MVP)
- **Goal Library Management**: 
  - Free-text goal input with flexible categorization
  - Multi-category tagging system (goals can have multiple tags)
  - Goal state tracking (to-do, in-play, completed)
  - Timestamp tracking for goal lifecycle
  - Renewable vs one-off goal settings with cooldown periods
  - Goal editing and deletion capabilities
- **Flexible Bingo Grid**: 
  - Configurable grid sizes from 2x2 to 10x10
  - Randomly populated from goal library
  - Automatic grid repopulation when rows/columns/diagonals are completed
  - Visual distinction between different goal states
- **Reward System**:
  - User-defined reward list management
  - Single reward selection upon row/column/diagonal completion
  - Reward tracking and history
- **Core Game Mechanics**:
  - Row/column/diagonal completion detection
  - Goal state transitions (to-do → in-play → completed)
  - Grid repopulation with new goals from library
  - Renewable goal cooldown management
  - Flexible grid size configuration
- **Data Persistence**: Local storage for goals, rewards, and game state
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

### Future Scope (Post-MVP)
- **Social Features**: Share achievements, compete with friends
- **Advanced Patterns**: Custom bingo patterns beyond rows/columns/diagonals
- **Statistics**: Progress tracking, streak counting, achievement history
- **Themes**: Multiple visual themes and customization options
- **Export/Import**: Backup and restore goal sets
- **Notifications**: Reminder system for incomplete goals
- **Team Mode**: Collaborative bingo boards for groups

### Out of Scope (V1)
- User authentication and cloud sync
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Integration with external goal tracking services
- Mobile native apps
- Offline functionality beyond local storage

## 5. Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Goal Management**
   - Create, read, update, delete goals
   - Mark goals as complete/incomplete
   - Reorder goals within the grid
   - Set goal categories or tags

2. **Bingo Logic**
   - Detect completed rows, columns, and diagonals
   - Support multiple simultaneous bingo patterns
   - Provide visual feedback for bingo achievements
   - Reset functionality for new bingo rounds

3. **User Interface**
   - Intuitive drag-and-drop goal management
   - Responsive design for all screen sizes
   - Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
   - Smooth animations and transitions

4. **Data Persistence**
   - Local storage for goals and progress
   - Data validation and error handling
   - Export/import functionality for backup

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**
   - Page load time < 2 seconds
   - Smooth 60fps animations
   - Responsive interactions < 100ms

2. **Compatibility**
   - Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
   - Mobile responsive (320px - 1920px)
   - Progressive Web App capabilities

3. **Usability**
   - Intuitive user experience requiring no training
   - Clear visual hierarchy and feedback
   - Keyboard navigation support

## 6. Architecture Overview

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and bundling
- **Testing**: Vitest for unit testing
- **Styling**: CSS Grid, Flexbox, CSS Custom Properties
- **Storage**: LocalStorage API
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages or Netlify

### Key Architectural Decisions
1. **Vanilla JavaScript**: Avoid framework complexity for MVP, focus on core functionality
2. **Component-Based Design**: Modular JavaScript classes for maintainability
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript
4. **Mobile-First**: Responsive design starting from mobile screens
5. **Local-First**: No backend dependency for MVP, data stored locally

## 7. Project Timeline
